Which slice provides the best coronal view of the amygdala?,110,210,188,53,234,84,coronalview,"The amygdala is a gray matter structure in the medial temporal lobe. It is part of the limbic system and is closely connected with many brain regions, including the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and prefrontal cortex.","The amygdala is crucial for emotion processing, particularly fear and anxiety, and plays an important role in memory, decision-making, and behavior. ","Dysfunction in the amygdala is associated with psychiatric issues such as anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorder, and PTSD, as well as difficulty with memory and decision making.","1.
