Which slice provides the best coronal view of the amygdala?,110,210,188,53,234,84,coronalview,"Telencephalic gray matter structure located in the anterior portion of the medial temporal lobe; the amygdala is a principal component of the limbic forebrain and is involved in emotion, cognition and the regulation of autonomic processes."
Which slice provides the best axial view of the amygdala?,138,152,184,59,173,79,axialview,"Telencephalic gray matter structure located in the anterior portion of the medial temporal lobe; the amygdala is a principal component of the limbic forebrain and is involved in emotion, cognition and the regulation of autonomic processes."
Which slice provides the best sagittal view of the amygdala?,79,102,52,36,64,93,sagittalview,"Telencephalic gray matter structure located in the anterior portion of the medial temporal lobe; the amygdala is a principal component of the limbic forebrain and is involved in emotion, cognition and the regulation of autonomic processes."
Which slice provides the best coronal view of the nucleus accumbens?,101,68,139,193,152,53,coronalview,"Ventral division of the striatum (basal ganglia) that receives command signals from the amygdala, hippocampus and orbital-medial prefrontal cortex and modulatory signals from dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area; provides phasic inhibitory input to pallidal structures (ventral pallidum and substantia nigra, pars reticulata) participating in a ventral 'limbic' loop of circuitry through the basal ganglia. The nucleus accumbens is an important structure that may be modulated by addictive drugs and contributes to behaviors associated with drug addiction."
