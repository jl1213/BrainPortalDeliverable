This repository contains the complete work of the Social Format Touchscreen Display Group within the Brain Portal: Designing Multimedia Displays for Duke Neuroscience (2024â€“2025) Bass Connections team. Our subteam was tasked to develop an interactive neuroscience educational tool optimized for use on large touchscreen tables. Seeing the limitations of traditional, static neuroscience learning methods, we aimed to produce a dynamic, customizable experience that works for both students and instructors to foster exploration, curiosity, and intuitive learning.

Traditional educational games often lack the flexibility and scientific depth required for advanced learning environments. We saw the need to develop more effective tools for spatial reasoning and complex visualization - many of the current day tools often emphasize rote memorization over meaningful engagement, which might feel rigid, superficial, or unintuitive to students learning neuroanatomy. To address these limitations, we aimed to create a highly 
interactive, customizable platform that encourages users to explore real MRI data (sourced from Duke Institute for Brain Sciences). Our goal is for 
students to gain geographic awareness in neuroscience. 

In our final product, users flip through coronal, sagittal, and axial slices of a real-life MRI brain, developing spatial architecture skills and intuition
through an interactive experience designed to emulate a 3D perspective of the brain.

This project is part of the larger Brain Portal initiative at the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences (DIBS) and was supported through the Bass Connections program at Duke University. We thank our mentors Dr. Len White and Professor Augustus Wendell for providing their valuable resources, expertise, and time.

#### **Notable Code Files**

## V4MCQ.cs
The V4MCQ.cs script manages the core logic of the touchscreen neuroscience quiz game. It initializes the scene (Start()), loads and parses quiz data from a CSV file (ReadCSVFile() and ParseCSVLine()), and displays questions and shuffled answer options (DisplayQuestion()). It handles player interactions by checking selected answers, updating scores, and providing immediate visual feedback (OnButtonTouch() and ResetButtonColors()). Correct or incorrect responses trigger transitions to a feedback scene (SwitchToSingleSlicer()). A countdown timer is managed in real time (Update()), adjusting a visible timer slider and enforcing penalties if time expires. 

## SceneSwitcher.cs
The SceneSwitcher.cs script manages transitions between scenes in the neuroscience touchscreen application. It tracks global game state variables such as the current question index, the selected brain structure, and associated anatomical information. It loads feedback scenes (SwitchToFeedbackScene()) that display correct brain slices and structure information, updates visual elements (Start()), and resets game state when needed (ResetGameState()). It also controls movement back to the main quiz scene (LoadMainScene()), ensuring the player progresses through the educational flow smoothly.

## V2AnimationController.cs
The V2AnimationController.cs script controls interactive playback of brain MRI animations. It allows users to move forward or backward through animation frames at adjustable speeds using UI buttons. The script manages animation state (PlayAnimation()), dynamically calculates and displays the current frame number (UpdateFrameDisplay()), and supports smooth manual navigation (MoveForward() and MoveBackward()). It also ensures necessary components like colliders and coordinate display scripts are attached when animations load. Playback speed is adapted based on the number of frames to maintain consistent frame timing across different animations.

## ShowCoord.cs
The ShowCoord.cs script lets users place, display, and copy coordinate markers on brain images, generating a spatial answer key for educational feedback.
